vinted-task
===========
cookbook name: `main-vinted`

Tested with:
`kitchen test default-centos-64`

Shortcomings:
  * Python script has hardcoded ip/port - could have used templating
  * Many unused cookbooks in the repo - didnt know how to properly clean up unused ones 
  * Only @localhost recipients are put into redis
  
  
Good morning, by the way :)
